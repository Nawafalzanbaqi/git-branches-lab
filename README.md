# git-branches-lab

A small lab to practice working with branches, merging, and handling merge conflicts in Git.

---

## 🗂 What I Practiced

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature1`  
2. Edit `notes.txt` in `feature1`, then run:  
   - `git add .`  
   - `git commit -m "edit in feature1"`  
3. Switch back to main: `git checkout main`  
4. Edit the same line in `notes.txt` in `main`, then commit the change.  
5. Merge `feature1` into `main`: `git merge feature1`  
6. Resolve the merge conflict manually in `notes.txt`.  
7. After fixing the conflict, run:  
   - `git add .`  
   - `git commit -m "resolve merge conflict"`

## 📌 Notes
This repository is only for practicing Git branching and conflict resolution.
